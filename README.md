# hello-world1

hello world! my name is jacob chung, and i am 18 years old. i have lived in numerous places, from florida to where i currently reside - rhode island. i'm interested in computer sciences and have always gravitated toward this field of work. when i was younger i became entranced in both console games and computer games. i then eventually built my own gaming pc (it was kinda garbage). now here i am, learning about software and programming.
